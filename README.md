Written in: Python 3.

A simple program that was originally made for a thesis project, and can be used to fetch and preprocess raw traffic flow data from Finnish LAM-sensors.

An elementary version of a preprocessing kit. Preprocesses spot detector data (i.e. cars detected at a certain spot on a road) to resampled data points for a chosen time interval. Covers two directions. No lane divisions implemented yet.
